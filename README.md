 This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling project focused on NIFTY 500 companies. The project involves analyzing sector-wise trends, revenue distribution, profit margins, and predictive modeling for EPS (Earnings Per Share) using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sector-wise company distribution
Industry-wise revenue and profit analysis
Correlation between financial metrics
Outlier detection in profit margins
Revenue vs. operating expenses visualization
EPS distribution across sectors

2. Predictive Analysis
Linear regression model to predict EPS based on financial indicators
Logistic regression for EPS classification (high vs. low)
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, data transformation
Model evaluation on test data

Technologies Used
Programming Language: R
Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, caret, lattice
Dataset
The analysis is based on the NIFTY 500 Quarterly Result dataset, which includes financial data such as revenue, net profit, operating expenses, and EPS.

How to Run
Load the dataset (NIFTY 500 Quarterly Result.csv).
Run the EDA script (Nifty 500 Upto EDA.R) to generate insights and visualizations.
Run the predictive analysis script (Nifty 500 predictive analysis.R) to train and evaluate models.
Results & Insights
The sector-wise analysis highlights dominant industries in terms of revenue and profit.
Strong correlation found between net profit and EPS.
The predictive model helps classify high and low EPS stocks based on financial performance.
